Nissaga is a tool to generate genealogy trees
from a simple data description in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

It is an extended rewrite in Python of the JavaScript tool [kingraph].
'Nissaga' is [a catalan word meaning _lineage_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nissaga).

## Installation

```bash
pip install nissaga
```

You need to install [graphviz]. Not the python wrapper library, but the program itself.

[kingraph]: https://github.com/rstacruz/kingraph
[graphviz]: https://graphviz.org

## Usage

```bash
nissaga draw myfamily.yaml
```

This generates a file `myfamily.pdf`

You can specify a second parameter to choose the output format: png, svg or any supported by graphviz.

```bash
nissaga draw myfamily.yaml svg
```

Get more information on the [command line documentation](docs/cli.md).

## Differences with kingraph

This application was started as a clone of the functionality of [kingraph]
to overcome performance and scalability problems with big trees,
and also to extend its functionality.

So, it is mostly back compatible with kingraph format.

The following kingraph features are not supported:

- `family.children2` and `family.parents2` relations are not yet supported

The following features have been introduced by nissaga, and are not available in kingraph (but the yaml would be still compatible).

- Rich **person boxes** with dates, photos and separated first name and surname.
	- `person.born` maybe set to a date, and will appear as `*YYYY-MM-DD` bellow the person's name.
	- `person.died` maybe set to a date or true and will appear as `+YYYY-MM-DD` bellow the person's name.
	- `person.age` age of dead, not used, just to keep track of it when that's the only data we have.
	- `person.pics` is a list of pictures files relative to the yaml file. The first one will be added as person's face. The other pics are not used yet.
- Rich **unions** with marriage and divorce annotations
	- `family.married`: defaults to true. Set it to false to indicate unmarried patnership (`⚯`). Set it to a date to see `⚭YYYY-MM-DD` in the union node.
	- `family.divorced`: defaults to false. Set it to true to indicate a divorce (`⚮`). Set it to a date to see `⚮YYYY-MM-DD` in the union node.
- Attributes for **internal documentation**:
	- `person.todo` a string or list of strings of pending tasks for the person
	- `person.from` origin of the person (country, city...)
	- `person.comments` a string or list of strings of comments
	- `family.notes` a string or list of strings of notes
	- `family.docs` documentation about the family. A list of document paths relative to the yaml file. Not used yet but it is suposed to provide links to the research sources.
